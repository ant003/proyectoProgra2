Snek is a game inspired in oldfashioned snake-like videogames where the player controls a snake around a map picking up food that makes it grow in size, if the snake bites itself in its quest to pick up food game's over.  
The objective is to survive as long as posible through the map, picking up food to make the snek longer and has the amount of food eaten as lives. If the snek hits a obstacule that refers to a n-integer, it loses n-lives obtained, if there are not more lives to lose, the game stops and the player lost.  
The controls provided will be minimal as the only movement will be at the x-axis, the snek will follow the mouse movement registered at the x-axis.

------------------------

## First to do
Implement the basis of the game. Put the snek represented by a block which moves only in the x-axis, while two types of food, one that will make the snek increase its size and the other one will decrease it, no obstacles will be available at this time and the speed of fall will be the same at all times. Size of the snake will be represented by a counter, not by the actual graphic of the snek.

## Second to do
Replace the bad food with obstacles represented by doors which will represent a factor to decrease the snek size. There will be at least 3 different types of doors for example: explicit numbers, aritmetic problems etc... The snek size will be both represented by the counter and by an actual relation within the counter and its graphic representation and the snek size will be related to the speed of scrolling of the view, giving the player a comprehensive window of time to react.
